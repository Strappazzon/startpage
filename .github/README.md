A startpage inspired by [this post on r/startpages](https://reddit.com/r/startpages/comments/9pwnwh/). I wanted the startpage to be minimal so I did not include a dock and I replaced the time and date with a list of some available bangs (the date and time are on the operating system's taskbar anyway).

## Preview

![New tab page preview](./preview.jpg)

## Usage

Go to <https://strappazzon.xyz/startpage/>

The default search engine is [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com/). You can also search with any supported website/search engine by typing an exclamation mark followed by its corresponding letter, a space and your search query. For example:

- `!sp GitHub` would search Startpage for GitHub

### Available bangs

- !sp [Startpage](https://www.startpage.com/)
- !g [Google](https://www.google.com/)
- !w [Wikipedia](https://www.wikipedia.org/)
- ...and [many more](https://duckduckgo.com/bang)
