## Description
A startpage inspired by [this post on r/startpages](https://old.reddit.com/r/startpages/comments/9pwnwh/creation_my_first_try_at_a_personalized_start_page/). I wanted the startpage to be minimal so I did not include a dock (I use the Bookmarks toolbar anyway) and I replaced the time and date with a list of supported bangs (the date and time are on the taskbar so there's no need to add them here).

## Usage
Go to https://strappazzon.github.io/startpage/

You can search any of the supported websites by typing an exclamation mark followed by its letter, followed by a space and your search query. For example:
 - `!s GitHub` would search Start Page for GitHub

The default search engine is DuckDuckGo (no need to type a bang for it). Others are:
 - !s [Start Page](https://new.startpage.com/)
 - !x [searX.me](https://searx.me/)
 - !g [Google](https://www.google.com/)
 - !w [Wikipedia](https://www.wikipedia.org/)

## Requirements
Just a modern browser which support JavaScript.
